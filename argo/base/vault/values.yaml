    # config is a raw string of default configuration when using a Stateful
    # deployment. Default is to use a PersistentVolumeClaim mounted at /vault/data
    # and store data there. This is only used when using a Replica count of 1, and
    # using a stateful set. This should be HCL.

    # Note: Configuration files are stored in ConfigMaps so sensitive data
    # such as passwords should be either mounted through extraSecretEnvironmentVars
    # or through a Kube secret.  For more information see:
