All benefits are paid\nby Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (Insurer) to HSBC Bank Canada to be credited 10 your insured mortgage, line of\ncredit or demand loan. This information sheet is for illustrative purposes only and does not form part of your Certificate.\n\nInsurance coverage is subject to limitations and exclusions. Please review the details and requirements of coverage\ncarefully before you apply.\n\nBenefits\nLife Insurance pays the qualifying balance of an insured mortgage, line of credit or demand loan in the event of death\n(up to $750,000). The gualifying balance is determined as follows:\n\nMortgagef(s): If the mortgage amount is less than or equal to $750,000 (at the time of enrolment), the qualifying\nbalance is (i} for blended payment mortgages, the outstanding principal balance (excluding principal or interest in\narrears), or (i) for interest-only mortgages, the outstanding principal balance (excluding interest in arrears), less\nan amount equal to the principal payments that would have been made on a blended mortgage with an equal\nopening balance based on the same interest rate and amortization period as your interest-only mortgage. If the\nmortgage amount is greater than $750,000, the qualifying balance is adjusted based on the ratio established as\nyour amount of insurance upon enrolment.\n\nLine of Credit or Demand Loan: The qualifying balance for an insured line of credit or demand loan is the lesser\nof (i) the outstanding balance on the date of death, (ii) the average debit balance for the 12 months preceding the\ndate of death, or (ili} the Loan Amount insured shown on your Application.\n\nDisability Insurance pays the minimum monthly payment in the event of a disability (up to $4,000 per month} for a\nmaximum of 24 months {in aggregate). In all cases, only one disability benefit will be paid at any one time. The benefit\nwill continue until the insured is no longer disabled or the maximum 24-month benefit period is reached. Disability\nInsurance is not available on any mortgage or line of credit with an interest-only repayment option. Demand Loans with\nHSBC Bank Canada are not eligible for disability insurance under Policy 57305.\n\nEligibility and Pre-Existing Conditions\nLife Insurance Eligibility: You must be between the ages of 18 and 64 on the date of application.\n\nDisability Insurance Eligibility: You must also have Life Insurance (under Policy 57905) and be actively at work for 20\nhours or more per week on the date of application.\n\nPre-Existing Conditions: Please be advised that no insurance benefit is paid if death orTotal Disability is directly\nor indirectly caused or contributed to by a Pre-Existing Condition {(and death orTotal Disability occurs in the\nfirst 12 months of coverage). A “Pre-Existing Condition” is a condition or health problem for which you consulted\nwith or received advice, treatment, care and/or service from a Licensed Medical Professional or you took medications\nor injections in the 12 months before becoming insured.\n\nWhat Is Not Paid\nNo benefit is paid If death or Total Disability is directly or indirectly caused or contributed to by:;\n\n« a Pre-Existing Condition (defined above), if your death or Total Disability occurs in the first 12 months of coverage;\n\n« suicide;\n\n+ an air travel accident, unless a fare-paying passenger or acting as a crew member of a regularly scheduled\ncommercial passenger airline flight,\n\n» active participation in a civil disarder or war {unless on active military duty with the Canadian Armed Forces or\nReserve): or\n\n* events which occur while you are committing or attempting to commit a criminal act.\n\n1019107-E_2014-02 Page 1¢i 3 In addition, no benefit is paid if Total Disability is directly or indirectly caused or contributed to by:\n\nnormal pregnancy (this exclusion does not apply to complications of pregnancy); or\n* an intentionally self-inflicted injury.\n\nWhen Your Coverage Begins and Ends\n\nThe insurance becomes effective on the later of: a) the date the application is signed by you; b) the date your funds are\n\nadvanced by HSBC Bank Canada: or ¢} the date written approval is granted by Insurer (in cases where the Application\nrequires written approval).\n\nCoverage automatically ends on the earliest of: a) the date the insured mortgage, line of credit or demand loan is paid\nin full or refinanced; b) the date of an insured person’s death: ¢) the date you turn /70 years of age (coverage continues\non younger insured, if any); d) the date your written request to cancel is received by HSBC Bank Canada; e) when vour\npremiums are 60 days in arrears or payment under your insured mortgage, line of credit or demand loan is 60 days in\narrears; 1) when Policy 57905 ends; g} for life insurance, when the maximum benefit is paid, h} for disability, upon the\n\nearlier of 24 monthly payments being paid on your behalf, the date life insurance is continued under Prior Coverage\nRecognition or the date life insurance ends.\n\nWhat Coverage Costs\n\nRates are determined based on the age of the borrower at the time of application (Mortgages) or on the payment due date\n(Lines of Credit/Dermand Loans). Joint coverage rates are based on the age of the oldest insured. Premiums are calculated\n\nand charged at the same frequency as the regular payment under the insured credit facility. Provincial sales taxes on\ninsurance premiums will be added, if applicable. The following outlines current rates (applicable at time of application).\n\nLife Insurance\n\nLines of Credit/Demand Loans under $50,000: For lines of credit and demand loans under $50,000 the applicable\n\nrates are $0.50 per 1,000 for single coverage and $0.85 per $1,000 for joint coverage regardless of your age at date\nof application. The monthly premium payable is calculated on the first day of the month by applying the rate to the\nprevious month's average daily debit balance. Example: If coverage is joint and your average daily debit balance for\nthe preceding month was $10,000, your premium payable = $8.50 calculated as follows: {$10,000 + 1,000) X 0.85.\n\nMortgages {any balance) and Lines of Credit/Demand Loans $50,000 and over:\n\n\n\n____ Monthly Premium Rates per $1,000 (plus applicable taxes)\n~ Age | 1830 | 31-35 36-40 | 41-45 46-50 51-55 56-60 | 61-64\n\ni\n\n\n\nSingle | $0.09 $0.13 $0.40 $0.53 $0.73 | $115\ne : | .E\no $0.14 $0.18 $0.56 $0.74 $1.02 $1.6\"\n\nMortgages (Blended and Interest-Only Payment): The monthly premium is calculated by applying the applicable\nrate (set out above) to your Loan Amount Insured. Example: If your age on the date yvou applied for insurance\n\nwas 33, you are the oldest insured borrower and your Loan Amount Insured is $325,000, your monthly premium\npayable Is $58.50 calculated as follows: ($325,000 «~ 1,000) X 0.18 = $58.50.\n\nLines of Credit/Demand Loans $50,000 and over: The monthly premium is calculated on the first day of the month\nby applying the applicable rate (set out above} to the previous month's average daily debit balance. Example: if\n\ncaverage is joint, the oldest insured is 38 years old on the date premiums are calculated and collected and the\naverage daily debit balance on the insured line of credit or demand loan for the preceding month was $75,000,\nyour premium payable = $20.25 calculated as follows: {$75,000 + 1.000) X $0.27 = $20.25.\n\nDisability Insurance\n\n\n\n56-60 | 61-64 |\n$5.40 $6.90\n\nThe premium payable for Diglabiiity Insurance is calculated by dividing your current payment by 100, multiplied by\nthe applicable premium rate. There are no joint rates for disability insurance.\n\nB B o -~ Premium Rates per $100 (plus applicable taxes)\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 3 Example: If your age is 33 and the previous month's payment due was $165.00, your disability insurance premium\npayable is $2.97 calculated as follows: ($165.00 + 100) X 1.80 = $2.97\n\nFree Look and Cancellation\n\nYou have 30 days from receipt of the Certificate to decide whether this insurance program is right for you.

Not Applrcable to Students, Applicants, Members-wm-Trammg, Life\nR Members or those with Non-Practicing Status. *\n\n1. Reporting Your Professional Development Hours (PDHs)\n\nIf you are a Professional Member, Licensee, or Professional Licensee, you must report your CPD hours\nannually. You must submit a minimum of 240 hours over three years and have reported hours in at least three of\n\nthe six categories each year. Refer to the CPD Program Guideline available on APEGA’s web site at\nhitps://www.apega.ca/members/cpd/ for further details.\n\n\n\nPlease submit your hours prior to the due date of the invoice for your membership dues. Login to Member\nSelf-Service Centre using your Member Number and Password to submit the CPD hours online.\n\n2. Consequences of Non-Compliance\n\nYou are also required to maintain a detailed record of your professional development activities and produce it\nwhen the practice review board (PRB) of APEGA requests it for a review. If you do not submit your CPD hours in\na timely manner as required and fail to produce the detailed activity record upon a request by the PRB, your\nregistration will be cancelled after 30 days' notice, in accordance with the Regulations under the Engineering and\nGeoscience Professions Act.\n\n3.

The declaration form is available at hitps://www.apega.ca/members/changes/; the\ncompleted form should be submitted to cpd@apega.ca. The declaration is valid only for one year from the date\nof the declaration. ‘Non-practicing’ members are exempt from the mandatory CPD program requirement outlined\nabove, but are not exempt from paying member dues.\n\n\n\nPlease note that practicing is not considered as being limited to stamping professional documents; it\nincludes acting as a Responsible Member for an APEGA Permit and all activities contained in the\ndefinitions of \"practice\" under the Engineering and Geoscience Professions Act.\n\n4. Resuming Active Practice (Going Back to Practicing)\n\nIf you had previously declared yourself to be ‘non-practicing” and intend to resume practice, you must obtain\npermission from the PRB. To do so, you must submit a completed Application for Permission to Resume\nPractice available at https://www.apega.ca/members/changes/. Upon review of the application, the PRB may\nrequire you to comply with certain conditions that it might set prior to allowing you to resume practicing.\n\n5. Requesting Special Consideration\n\nIf you are not able to meet the requirements of the CPD program because you are employed part-time,\nunemployed, on dues deferment, on parental-maternity leave, in a full-time educational program or have\nhealth/disability issues, you may qualify for special consideration to have your required PDHs reduced.

Selling mortgage loans to Freddie Mac is a standard part of the mortgage\nbusiness for many of the nation’s mortgage lenders. The sale of your mortgage loan to Freddie Mac does\nnot affect any term, payment, or condition of the mortgage, deed of trust, or note.\n\nYour Servicer is the company to which you currently make your mortgage payments. This may or may not\nbe the same company who made your mortgage loan. Your Servicer at the time of this notification is\n\nAMERIHOME MORTGAGE COMPANY, LLC, CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT PO BOX 77404,\nEWING, NJ 77404, (855) 501-3035.\n\nIf your name(s) or address requires any corrections, or if you have any questions about your payments,\nplease contact your Servicer.\n\nPlease continue to make your payments to your current Servicer as you do today. When or if there is a\nchange in who collects your payments, your Servicer will contact you and provide necessary guidance. Do\nnot send your mortgage payments to Freddie Mac, as we do not service mortgage loans.\n\nPartial Payment\nFreddie Mac’s partial payment policy permits the Servicer to do any of the following:\n\n° it may accept a partial payment (a payment that is less than the full amount due) and apply it\nto your mortgage loan,\n\n° it may hold a partial payment in a separate account until you pay the rest of the payment, and\nthen apply the full payment to your mortgage loan, or\n° it may refuse to accept any partial payments.\n\nIf you wish to make a payment that is less than the full amount due for your regularly scheduled monthly\npayment, you may contact your Servicer to discuss how it will treat a partial payment from you.\n\nIf this loan is sold, your new lender/owner may have a different partial payment policy.\n\nPlease keep a copy of this notice with your other mortgage documents because the sale of your\nmortgage loan to Freddie Mac has not been publicly recorded.\n\nyou have questions regarding this notice, visit our online FAQs at\n\nhttp://myhome.freddiemac.com/own/borrower notification letter fags.html\n\nWritten inquiries should be addressed to 8200 Jones Branch Drive, McLean VA, 22102, Attention: Borrower\nContact Unit, Mail Stop A29.\n\nUna versién en espaiiol de esta carta esta disponsible en nuestro sitio web:\n\nh\n\nttp://www. freddiemac.com/forms.\n\n\n\n003264836 [\n\nb\n\nma e s AAAA AT AAAT ARA AT AAR\n\nB\n\n2\n3+\n\n0141505768 OE\n\nAQA AmeriHome\nA YA mortgage\nNMLSID 135776\n\nWelcome to AmeriHome Mortgage!\n\nOLEG MEDVEDYEV October 15, 2020\n\n14 MANGIA TOWER CT\nMISSOURI CITY, TX 77459\n\nLoan Number: 0141505768\n\n+Dear OLEG MEDVEDYEV:\n\n«Your loan servicing has transferred from TOP ONE MORTGAGE L.L.C. to AmeriHome Mortgage\n2\n\nompany, LLC.

FMFs include:\n\n16424\n\n* Investment management fees {IMFs): IMFs pay for professional investment managers to select the\nunderlying fund's investments and build the fund's portfolio. These fees also pay for the recordkeeping of\nyour account and member servicing costs. ,\n\n+ Operating expenses: These expenses are generally for the buying and selling of securities for a fund, as well\nas any expenses relating to the operation of a fund at both the underlying and segregated fund level.\nOperating expenses are charged directly to the fund and included in the calculation of the daily unit value.\n\nSchlumberger Canada pays the IMFs en your behalf in your DCPP and DPSP - you are only responsible for the\noperating expenses. This means more of your hard-earned contributions remain in your account for your\nretirement.\n\nYou are responsible for the full FMFs in your RRSP and TFSA. The fees you pay in the plan are generally much\nlower than what you would pay as an individual at a bank or a mutual fund company.\n\nTo view the fees that you pay in each of the products you participate in, sign in to\nwww.mysunlife.ca/schlumberger using your access ID and password, then select 'my financial centre’ >\nAccounts » Account Fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to Sun Life Financial 2015 Granite® Target Date Fund\n\nThe Sun Life Financial 2015 Granite® Target Date Fund matured on June 29, 2015, at which time all assets and\nfuture contributions were automatically transferred to the Sun Life Financial Granite Retirement Segregated\nFund.\n\n“Plan members who held the fund in a non-registered account may experience a capital gain or loss as a result of\nthe fund maturity. Capital gains must be reported for the tax year the transfer is completed.\n\nYou are not required to take any action at this time; however, it's always a good idea to review your current\ninvestment options to ensure that they continue to meet your retirement goals. You can do this by re-visiting\nyour Investment risk profiler found in your my money@work guide or on www.mysunlife.ca. Through\n\nMorningstar® - a leading provider of investment news and analysis - you can access an overview of the funds in\nyour plan, including the fund's objective, performance, risk and how the fund is invested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Defined Contribution Pension Plan profile\n\n\n\nPension Plan for Participating Divisions of Schlumberger Canada Limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPl e IS A ST UMD E D s 35000 B3GR 5 Ko smssssss 1041110 ®\nVWHETE FESISTOrED. ..o sermusssmcssarmrssseusassrasnssiin 5 3mSR e monsss e s ST 5 Alberta % / }\nPROVINGE O Pl OYIIE I simssosorsss s s s i ssareavesmsrins nsessosssosisgi s T T Alberta FSC\n\ne se.org\n\nMIX\n\nPaper from\nresponsible sources\n\nFSC* C101537\n\n{continued on next page) 16425\n\n\n\nMy Defined Contribution Pension Plan profile (continued)\nMy beneficiary\n\n.....................................................
